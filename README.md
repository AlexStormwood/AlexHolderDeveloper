By both teaching & developing, Alex has the communication skills needed to help anyone learn anything, and to help anyone create anything.



Alex has been focusing on game development for a long time now, using the Unity game engine & C# programming language for the bulk of his work. In recent years, he branched out into web development and has been exploring ways to combine the two areas to create larger-scale game products. 

With the design & tech knowledge to cover the gamedev pipeline himself, Alex has recently been burying himself in programming-heavy sections of game development such as:

* Building custom cloud systems for games (eg. accounts, cloud savedata, ingame news & ecommerce) using ExpressJS, Firebase/GCP & AWS
* Implementing game bootflows to connect to the above systems in a way that can be dropped into multiple game projects using Unity & C#
* Getting production & product approvals for various cross-platform & connectivity features on exclusive platforms such as the Nintendo Switch
* Using data-oriented design to increase performance in both singleplayer & multiplayer game projects with Unity's new DOTS systems
