Role changed a lot over the years! Began as a casual event assistant while being a student at Coder Academy's sister-school, Academy of Information Technology (AIT). Eventually working for events for AIT and Coder Academy. Then after graduating and working & studying elsewhere, I came back as an assistant educator for both AIT and Coder Academy covering web development, game development, augmented reality, and more.

When COVID hit, this role consolidated into being an educator for just the Coder Academy side of the business, performing both teaching assistance and lead teaching roles in various web development and cyber security courses.

This is "me as my own business" -- consulting and freelancing for projects ranging from graphic design logo commissions, to virtual reality experience design & development, to bespoke private tutoring. If someone needs help making something or learning something, I can answer the call!

Also the vehicle for me to publish videogames, such as Planet Protector VR - designed, developed and published by just me - to multiple platforms. Continued as an indie game development business to this day when not doing client contract projects or Coder Academy work.

## About ðŸŽ®

He currently works as an educator & course developer for Coder Academy, covering web development, game development, and various other STEM topics. His courses have reached a huge variety of ages & audiences, in all ranges of education from primary school to university & even staff development.

</p>
By both teaching & developing, Alex has the communication skills needed to help anyone learn anything, and to help anyone create anything.



Alex has been focusing on game development for a long time now, using the Unity game engine & C# programming language for the bulk of his work. In recent years, he branched out into web development and has been exploring ways to combine the two areas to create larger-scale game products. 

With the design & tech knowledge to cover the gamedev pipeline himself, Alex has recently been burying himself in programming-heavy sections of game development such as:

* Building custom cloud systems for games (eg. accounts, cloud savedata, ingame news & ecommerce) using ExpressJS, Firebase/GCP & AWS
* Implementing game bootflows to connect to the above systems in a way that can be dropped into multiple game projects using Unity & C#
* Getting production & product approvals for various cross-platform & connectivity features on exclusive platforms such as the Nintendo Switch
* Using data-oriented design to increase performance in both singleplayer & multiplayer game projects with Unity's new DOTS systems
